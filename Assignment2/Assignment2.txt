Task 1:
a) We are finding all the regular files in the etc directory and its subdirectories and listing their path names in file one.txt.
   Any errors that occur while executing this command are printed to file two.txt.
b) one.txt contains a list of file path names that begin with '/etc/'.
   two.txt contains a list of error messages that describe the unsuccessful command, the file the error occured on, and the reason for error.

Task 2:
Output of command used:

     15 2006,Mar
     13 2014,Jul
     12 2014,Aug

As per the Dataset, Top 3 [Month, Year] with the most number of Youtube channels created were:
1. March, 2006 with 15 channels
2. July, 2014 with 13 channels
3. August, 2014 with 12 channels

The command used to find it was this: cut -d ',' -f 20-21 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 3 >> Assignment2.txt

This command displays the top 3 [Number_of_Youtube_Channels_Created Year, Month] from the 'Global Youtube Statistics.csv' file from greatest to least Number_of_Youtube_Channels_Created.

Parameters:
The cut command extracts the 20th (created year) and 21st (created month) columns from the Global YouTube Statistics.csv file.
The first sort command sorts the dates [Year,Month] outputted from the previous cut command from least to most recent.
The uniq command prefixes each line outputted from the previous sort command with the number of occurrences and removes duplicate lines.
The second sort command sorts the lines outputted from the previous uniq command by the number of occurrences from most to least frequent. 
The head command displays the first 3 lines outputted from the previous sort command, which contain the top 3 [Year, Month] with the most number of YouTube channels.

Task 3:
Command used: ps -u sandrasp24
Output:
 
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3563974 ?        00:00:00 systemd
3563976 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3563984 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3563985 pts/34   00:00:00 bash
3566345 pts/34   00:00:00 ps

Task 4:
a) vi file.txt 
b) Output of 'ps -u sandrasp24' after executing 'vi file.txt' on first terminal:

    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3563974 ?        00:00:00 systemd
3563976 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3563984 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3563985 pts/34   00:00:00 bash
3569870 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3569871 pts/48   00:00:00 bash
3570152 pts/34   00:00:00 vim
3570395 pts/48   00:00:00 ps

The sshd and bash processes for both terminals are listed as running processes, as well as the vim process executed by the 'vi file.txt' command that is executed on the first terminal. The Process ID for the vim is 3570152.
c) q!
d) Output of 'ps -u sandrasp24' after quitting vi:
 
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
3563974 ?        00:00:01 systemd
3563976 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3563984 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3563985 pts/34   00:00:00 bash
3569870 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3569871 pts/48   00:00:00 bash
3571684 pts/48   00:00:00 ps

The vim process is no longer listed as a running process because the process was terminated by the q! option. The sshd and bash processes of both terminals are still listed as running because they are both still open.

Task 5:
The init process is the first process to run. It is invoked by the kernel at startup and executes one /etc/getty per terminal or one sshd per remote ssh connection.

Process ID for the init process is 1.

Command to find the process id for the init process: ps aux | grep systemd

Task 6:
The 'ps aux' command displays the information of all running processes of all users, including those that are not associated with a terminal, in user-oriented format. The information includes content such as user, Process ID, percentage of CPU usage, percentage of memory usage, state of the process, the associated command or process name, etc.
